For your first project, you'll be creating a familiar game using HTML, CSS and
JS! Please choose one of the following options:

- **Trivia (Self-scoring)**

I created a trivia game that pulls trivia questions from https://opentdb.com/api.php there are three standard catagories and one mixed category that can be from any category. I used the bootstrap CSS framework for mobile first CSS as well as JQuery.

There are three levels of questions easy medium and hard.

Some unimplemented ideas is timed scoring, high scores and difficulty settings.
